### Data Storytelling

[Sale Price Prediction in San Francisco](/html/House Price Prediction.html)
<br>
In this project, we build an OLS model to predict 700 home sale prices in San Francisco from 2012-2015 based on 9433 known data entries. It successfuly takes spatial autocorrelation into accounts. The final outcome is pretty impressive with a **mean absolute error (MAE) of 230000** and an **absolute percent error (MAPE) of 23%**. R-Square value reaches to nearly 75% which means the model accounts for about 75% of the variance of sale prices.
