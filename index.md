### Data Storytelling

#### [Sale Price Prediction in San Francisco](/html/House Price Prediction.html)

In this project, we build an OLS model to predict 700 home sale prices in San Francisco from 2012-2015 based on 9433 known data entries. It successfuly takes spatial autocorrelation into accounts. 
<br>
The final outcome is pretty impressive with a **MAE of 230000** and an **MAPE of 23%**. In general, it is a pretty good model that describes both local demographics and physical characteristics of the housing.

#### [Space-Time Prediction of Scooter Activity in Louisville, KY](https://xinyimsumyee.github.io/html/scooters.html)

We use the data set from Louisville open data and focus on scooter trips from March to August. OLS regression models are built here to predict the pickup and return activity respectively.
<br>
We project the trips count on census tract and fishnet. **Census tract** level prediction provide a general understanding of the demand across the city. **Fishnet** level provides more details to assist staff target the excess demand or supply areas and re-balance efficiently. 
<br>
To determine whether there is an excess supply or demand, we **subtract the predicted demand and supply**.

<br><br>
Then we design an app use case for re-balancing staff based on the prediciton result. For more about our app **Sco-Porter**, here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xheEpq_Ij4E)!
